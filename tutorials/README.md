# OpenGL "Beginner's Tutorials" in julia

The tutorials in this directory closely follow the
[beginner's tutorials](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/),
written in julia.  The first couple (`tutorial01.jl` and
`tutorial02a.jl`) adhere to low-level manipulations, using just
[GLFW](https://github.com/JuliaGL/GLFW.jl) and
[ModernGL](https://github.com/JuliaGL/ModernGL.jl). Starting with
`tutorial02b.jl`, more of the "julian" conveniences available in
GLAbstraction are introduced.

A good way to proceed is to go read the tutorials, but for code refer
to these completed programs.
