# GLAbstraction
A simple library, which makes the use of OpenGL a little bit more convinient and Julian.
If you have any questions, please open an issue. I'm working lazily on the documentation, so if no one asks, there won't be any documentation ;)

Note there are some [tutorials](tutorials/README.md).

### Features
* Some linear algebrae, to do all kinds of transformations.
* Aliases for ImmutableArrays, which are more GLSL alike (e.g. Vector3{Float32} -> Vec3, Matrix4x4{Float32} -> Mat4)
* All the different glUniform functions are wrapped and the right function is determined via multiple dispatch (just works for ImmutableArrays and Real numbers)
* Buffers and Texture objects are wrapped, with best support for arrays of ImmutableArrays. 
* Shader loading is simplified and offers templated shaders and interactive editing of shaders and type/error checks.
* Offers the type `RenderOject`, which helps you preparing the OpenGL state to render data with a shader. 
* Event handling with [React](https://github.com/shashi/React.jl)
* Two camera types (PerspectiveCamera and OrthogonalCamera), which can be instantiated with a list of React signals from GLWindow. You can also supply your own signals.
* Some wrappers for often used functions, with embedded error handling and more Julian syntax




### Example:
```julia

#Status
There is still quite a bit missing.
